# Homework 6: Data wrangling wrap up

In this homework, we learn how to write a function in R, cleaning of data, working with lists using `purrr` package. 

This repository contains several files, some of the are those that create while running the code, for example, those used to same data. 
Here is brief description of the important folders;

0. README.md : contains a brief descitption of the repository
1. Homework6.Rmd: R markdown document that contains the code for the homework
2. Homework6.html: html document that contains the code for the homework
3. Homework6.nb.html: another html code for the .Rmd file

**Note:** The  .Rmd file may not display properly, and the .html file will only displat the rwa html code.

Due to the issue, I have attached a link to a git webpage that contains the html document that displays properly. Please bear
with me as the page may be slow when loading. [Click here to access the html file](https://iyaniwura.github.io/hw5/Homework6.html)
